# PhotonVision Benchmarking

A setup to read PhotonVision data from NetworkTables from a vision co-processor. 

Goals of this tool are:
1. Test and tune the camera calibration
2. Measure error and noise.
3. Benchmark FPS, latency, and jitter as seen by the robot
4. Create camera configuration

A work in progress. (just started actually)
